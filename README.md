Learning these days is really a little broken. There is too much academic pressure. I don't know why I can't learn at home, but I can't stand learning every day in school. It seems that people really need a combination of work and rest, and anxiety is the most tormenting. I also want to have a good rest during the National Day holiday, but I can't help it. I still have to study. I don't feel enough time every day. I have to learn too much, but my attention is a little lower. I can't learn one thing wholeheartedly. Maybe it's difficult. If you understand it and are interested in it, you will gradually forget the time and learn it with special investment. You really miss that time and study happily. Then there is the PTE exam, and I have to prepare this thing at the same time. Now I am preparing three things at the same time, and each is a big head, but it will be very, very easy after solving one. Don't say much, you have to start learning again.
